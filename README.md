# Cryptocurrencies

### **Purpose**
- The purpose of the project was to create a report that includes cryptocurrencies that are traded and how to group  them. To create the report an unsupervised machine learning process was used.

### **Results**
- After creating the report I can see what cryptocurrencies are being mined, total coins mined, and total supply.

### **Summary**
- This project really helped me understand how to use an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.
